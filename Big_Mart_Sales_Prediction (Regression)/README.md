# Big Mart Sales Prediction

## Overview
The Big Mart Sales Prediction project aims to build a predictive model to estimate the sales of various products in Big Mart stores. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical sales data and derive insights for improved inventory and sales strategies.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries 
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature encoding.
- Model training using multiple algorithms, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Extra Trees Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
