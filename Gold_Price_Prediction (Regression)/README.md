# Gold Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting gold prices using historical data and various machine learning regression models. By leveraging features that impact gold prices, we aim to build an accurate predictive model, analyze feature importance, and evaluate model performance based on key metrics.

## Overview
Gold prices are influenced by a range of economic and financial factors. In this project, we use machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and predict gold prices, helping to understand potential predictors of gold market trends.
This is a regression-based prediction project where the target variable is the gold price.

### Implemented multiple regression models:
- **LinearRegression**
- **DecisionTreeRegressor**
- **RandomForestRegressor**
- **ExtraTreesRegressor**
- **GradientBoostingRegressor**

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries 
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
