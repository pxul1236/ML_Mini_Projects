# Iris Flower Classification

This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on their physical dimensions using the Iris dataset. The goal is to accurately predict the species of an iris flower given its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Model Training

The project includes several machine learning models for classification:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of each model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)

## Future Work

In the future, I plan to:
- Implement Flask to create a web application for the model.
- Use Pickle to save the trained models for easy loading in the Flask app.
- Expand the project to include more datasets or different classification algorithms.
