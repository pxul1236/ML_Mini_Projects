# Titanic Dataset Analysis Classification

The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets used for machine learning classification problems. This project aims to analyze the data and build a predictive model to classify whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, and class.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Model Training

The project includes several machine learning models for classification:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Extra trees Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of each model is evaluated using Accuracy Score.
